# fuzzburn

fuzzburn generates random tensor programs and runs them through Burn, looking for:

| Bug class | How it is detected |
|---|---|
| Panics / assertion failures | libFuzzer catches any `panic!` / `abort` |
| Missing gradients | `fuzz_autograd` asserts both leaf tensors have `Some` gradient after `backward()` |
| Shape / dtype errors | Triggered by the op-sequence structure driving illegal combinations |

I want **differential fuzzing** in the future, so we run the same generated program through two backends (e.g. NdArray vs WGPU) and compare numeric outputs.

## Architecture

The fuzzer is built around a small **IR / AST**:

```
arbitrary (libFuzzer bytes)
      │
      ▼
 TensorProgram / AutogradProgram   ← program.rs  (AST root)
      │  owns a Vec of
      ▼
 TensorOp / DiffOp / TensorRef    ← ops.rs       (instruction set)
      │
      ▼
 interpreter.rs                   ← tree-walker → Burn tensor calls
```

This separation means:
- AST: op enums and program structs are **Burn-agnostic** – they describe *what* to compute.
- Burn entry: `interpreter.rs` is the only file that imports Burn – swapping backends or adding a second backend for differential testing only requires changes there.

## File structure (gpt gen lol)

```

├── Cargo.toml                  # main crate (fuzzburn lib + bin)
├── src/
│   ├── main.rs                 # stub entry point / usage hints
│   ├── lib.rs                  # re-exports `pub mod ir`
│   └── ir/
│       ├── mod.rs              # module declarations

│       ├── program.rs          # TensorProgram, AutogradProgram (AST roots)
│       └── interpreter.rs      # evaluates a program against Burn
├── examples/

└── fuzz/
    ├── Cargo.toml              # cargo-fuzz crate, depends on fuzzburn
    ├── fuzz_tensor_ops.rs      # fuzz target: plain tensor API
    └── fuzz_autograd.rs        # fuzz target: autodiff + backward pass
```

## Prerequisites

```sh
# Rust nightly is required by cargo-fuzz / libFuzzer
rustup install nightly

# Install cargo-fuzz
cargo install cargo-fuzz
```

## Running the examples

```sh
cargo run --example simple_autograd
```

## Running the fuzz targets

```sh
# Fuzz the plain tensor API (shape ops, activations, reductions)
cargo +nightly fuzz run fuzz_tensor_ops

# Fuzz the autodiff backend (backward pass, gradient correctness)
cargo +nightly fuzz run fuzz_autograd

# Fuzz autodiff with LibTorch oracle comparison
cargo +nightly fuzz run fuzz_autograd --features oracle-tch
```

Useful flags:

```sh
# Limit each run to 1 second of wall time (good for CI)
cargo fuzz run fuzz_tensor_ops -- -max_total_time=60

# Run with more parallelism
cargo fuzz run fuzz_autograd -- -workers=4

# Minimise a crashing input after finding a bug
cargo fuzz tmin fuzz_autograd <path/to/crash>
```

Crash artifacts are saved to `fuzz/artifacts/<target>/`.

## Roadmap

- [ ] **burn-ir differential fuzzing** – lower the same `TensorProgram` AST into `burn_ir::OperationDescription` nodes and replay it on two backends, comparing outputs.
- [ ] Higher-rank tensors (3-D, 4-D) and batched ops.
- [ ] Structured seed corpus of known interesting inputs.
